Service to obtain vehicle resources 

* For testing and view the code in the project I recommend using the IntelliJ IDE (free Community or Ultimate edition)
     
     https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

* How to run : 
     
     Install Gradle
     
     In terminal execute: `./gradlew bootRun`
     
     When the server is booted wait 10 seconds
     
     Every minute the process will run
     
     You can change these settings
      
     
* TODO :
    
    Use CompletableFuture class
    
    Use reactive programming with Spring Reactor or RxJava
    
    Use Webhooks
